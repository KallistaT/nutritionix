This is a demonstration of connecting to and requesting data from the Nutritionix API in Python. Nutritionix is the world's largest verified nutritional database that contains nutritional information on thousands of grocery foods, restaurant foods, and common foods. 
When making requests, you must provide a valid appID and appKey, and must also provide filters, queries, or query properties in your JSON object. You may also have to set the Content-Type to application/json in your header.
